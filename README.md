# **My Portfolio**

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository contains a collection of projects I’ve worked on, including real-time graphics, C++ development, software architecture, and more. Below, you’ll find a list of my projects, along with descriptions and links to the respective repositories or external demos where available.

## **Projects**

### **1. Garden of Atlantis**  
- **Description**:  
  "Garden of Atlantis" was my final project for the **Realtime Graphics** course, where I created a beautiful garden scene incorporating rendering techniques from the course. I used **raymarching** for the water and clouds and implemented **procedurally generated trees** to add life to the scene.
  
- **Technologies**: Godot

### **2. Simple 3D Engine with Particle-Based Fluids**  
- **Description**:  
  As part of my **Master's Thesis**, I developed a simple **C++ and OpenGL** rendering engine. The engine supports **instanced rendering** to visualize **particle-based fluids** by rendering thousands of spheres. This project was aimed at visualizing fluid simulations efficiently.

- **Technologies**: C++, OpenGL

### **3. AI-Generated Rendering Pipeline**  
- **Description**:  
  For my **Bachelor's Thesis**, I explored how traditional game rendering pipelines can be replaced with **AI-generated imagery** using **Godot**, **Stable Diffusion**, and **ControlNet**. The goal was to generate convincing imagery for sequential frames in a game engine.

- **Technologies**: Godot, Stable Diffusion, ControlNet

### **4. USD Importer for Mitsuba3 Renderer**  
- **Description**:  
  As part of a research project during my master's, I implemented a **USD importer** plugin for the **Mitsuba3 Renderer**. This plugin allows the renderer to integrate **USD scene data** for high-quality rendering using the **C++ and Python APIs** of Mitsuba.

- **Technologies**: C++, Mitsuba3, USD (Universal Scene Description)

### **5. Audio Middleware for Godot**  
- **Description**:  
  I developed my own **audio middleware plugin** for **Godot** after encountering limitations with existing solutions, such as licensing issues and missing web export support. This plugin is designed with scalability in mind and will be released as **Open Source** once it is production-ready.

- **Technologies**: Godot Engine

### **6. Shader Portfolio**  
- **Description**:  
  I enjoy experimenting with shaders and creating **real-time graphics effects**. Below are some examples of my work in shader development:

  - **Parallax Mapping Shader**: A parallax-mapped card with a snake game inside.
  - **Dice Shader**: A simple, reflective dice shader.
  - **Pixelated Fire Shader**: A pixelated fire effect, created for my current game project.
  - **Pixelated Vignette**: A pixelated vignette effect for my game project.

- **Technologies**: GLSL, Godot, Real-time Shading
